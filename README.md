# Betty---The-C-Shell
A customized shell built in C for the Operating Systems and Networks course at IIITH. Itâ€™s packed with features like command execution, job control, input/output redirection, piping, custom commands and history tracking. This project is a fun and hands-on way to explore system calls, process management, and how shells work.
